What is self-improvement:
Self-improvement is the act or process of improving oneself by oneâ€™s own actions; it is an instance or result of such improvement. This improvement helps re-focus our lives and typically results in a positive change. It takes time, but the time dedicated to self-improvement is substantial. 
The ultimate aim of self-improvement is to become a better version of oneself, achieve personal fulfillment, and live a more meaningful life.

Why is it important:
Self-improvement is crucial because it leads to personal growth and an increased sense of self-awareness. It boosts an individual's confidence in their abilities and enhances communication skills, resulting in stronger relationships. It also leads to better job performance and increased opportunities for career advancement. Self-improvement activities like exercising regularly and practicing mindfulness can lead to better physical and mental health. In summary, self-improvement helps individuals achieve their full potential and lead more fulfilling lives.

Progression over perfection:
perfection is often an unattainable and unrealistic goal. Striving for perfection can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and low self-esteem, as well as a fear of failure.
On the other hand, focusing on progression involves setting achievable goals and making progress over time. It allows for mistakes and learning opportunities, leading to personal growth and development.
Moreover, progression is a continuous process, and there is always room for improvement. It allows individuals to enjoy the journey and celebrate their achievements along the way.
