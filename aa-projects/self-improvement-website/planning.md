H2---<div class="Paragraphs__Header>Progression over perfection=</div>
---p---
perfection is often an unattainable and unrealistic goal. Striving for perfection can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and low self-esteem, as well as a fear of failure.
On the other hand, focusing on progression involves setting achievable goals and making progress over time. It allows for mistakes and learning opportunities, leading to personal growth and development.
Moreover, progression is a continuous process, and there is always room for improvement. It allows individuals to enjoy the journey and celebrate their achievements along the way.
