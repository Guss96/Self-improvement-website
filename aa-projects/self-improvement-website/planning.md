perfection is often an unattainable and unrealistic goal. Striving for perfection can lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, and low self-esteem, as well as a fear of failure.

Moreover, progression is a continuous process, and there is always room for improvement. It allows individuals to enjoy the journey and celebrate their achievements along the way.
